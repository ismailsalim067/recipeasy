# RecipEasy

## Overview

RecipEasy is a student-focused recipe web application built with Django. Anyone can browse and search recipes, but logged-in users can contribute and interact with the community by uploading recipes, saving favourites, rating recipes (1–5 stars), and leaving comments.

The app is designed around quick, practical cooking for students — helping users discover reliable meals, keep a personal collection of saved recipes, and use community feedback (ratings/comments) to find the best options.
